Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one

You do favors, then rapidly
Just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me

Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, but you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now, you see how quiet it is all alone

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say

A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean

Yeah, we're rolling, living outside now
Every moon has been chosen
We're doing alright now
Thought I'd say something, you'd be proud of me
Still selling someone I forgot at seventeen
Don't call me stupid
We all just need a little kindness
To reach back from those mistakes before they can find us
Alone 'til the stone bleeds
I will work everything out, show me

No one's gonna shed a tear
No need to shout

We will spend time
In the early morning's haze
You sit and wait
Watching full glasses through blank eyes

Not what you had in mind
This is not what you wanted
Not what you had in mind


Vacuous winter's there
Worn-out version of yourself
Too tough to fall
But not strong enough to turn

I knew I'd never be the same


Being happy
You were with me


As the time went on
I watched you slip away
Had you at the table
But couldn't set a place
It's funny how out of feel your mind can run away
I guess the payback is to live with your mistakes


Took for granted
What we had
Guess I hoped that
You would stay here


What is it that I need
To feel satisfied?
Your love makes me feel
Terrified


I guess I'll call it bad timing
Or say it's lesson learnin'
Oh well, it's happened again
What is my problem?

Naturally the dying man wonders to himself:
Has commentary been more lucid than anybody else?
And had he successfully beaten back the rising tide
Of idiots, dilettantes, and fools
On his watch while he was alive
Lord, just a little more time


Oh, in no time at all
This'll be the distant past, ooh


So says the dying man once I'm in the box
Just think of all the overrated hacks running amok
And all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked
The homophobes, hipsters, and one percent
The false feminists he'd managed to detect
Oh, who will critique them once he's left?


Oh, in no time at all
This'll be the distant past


What he'd give for one more day to rate and analyze
The world made in his image as of yet to realize
What a mess to leave behind


Eventually the dying man takes his final breath
But first checks his news feed to see what he's 'bout to miss
And it occurs to him a little late in the game
We leave as clueless as we came
From the rented heavens to the shadows in the cave
We'll all be wrong someday


Oh, oh, oh",Sad

He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man


Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me


Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention


As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free


Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention


So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem


Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today


Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right


I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man


Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)

So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but

There is no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving


Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together


Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look up at stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together


And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too

Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now


Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together


I believe in memories
They look so...
So pretty when I sleep
And I wa...
And when I wake up
You look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is
Not enough time
And there is no...
No song I could sing
And there is no
Combination of words I could say
But I will still
Tell you one thing

Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high

Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""

I can feel, too much is never enough

To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, me and you's like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

All those Saturdays when kids go out and play
Yo, I was up in my room – I let the stereo blaze
Wasn't faded, not jaded

I can see it in their eyes
It's close enough to touch it now
But far away enough to die

What the hell is wrong with me?
My mom and dad weren't perfect
But still you don't hear no cryin' ass-bitchin' from me
Like there seems to be on everybody's CD
So just sit back and relax and let me have your head for a minute
I can show you somethin' in it that has yet to be presented, oh, yeah!

Why's my mother always right?
And will I make it 'til the end
Or will I crawl away and die?

With abandon in their eyes
But in our bedroom we're bloodshot and beat
And never so alive


And I know what's on your mind
God knows I put it there
But if I took it back
We'd be nowhere
You'd be nowhere again


Now look at you all torn up
I left you waiting to bleed
I guess the truth works two ways
Maybe the truth's not what we need



But in my cold arms
You don't sleep
In my cold arms
Your fear beats
In my cold arms
You stay",Sad

You gotta keep 'em separated


Like the latest fashion
Like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Gettin' weapons with the greatest of ease
The gangs stake out their own campus locale
And if they catch you slippin', then it's all over, pal
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up...


Hey! Man, you talkin' back to me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey! Man, you disrespectin' me?
Take him out

Hey, they don't pay no mind
If you're under 18, you won't be doing any time
Hey! Come out and play


By the time you hear the siren
It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste
It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own...

Pity me in the end

And the sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me

Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth


Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences


Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it


Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

Conversation don't come easy
But I've got a lot to say

Well it feels many moons away

And I craved you
I lost sleep with you
Who knew?
No one loves me quite like you do

And sure as hell not the last

But we felt like it should have been

Don't think that I really cared for who or what
So for now I'll just have to keep it shut


If you're not ready, you're not ready
Please stop acting like you are


How could I know
That everything you say are lies
About devotion and desire?
And I know the spark
Inside your eyes was just the match
I used to set myself on fire


My mouth's shooting blanks
Situation's unbearable
I've gotten vulnerable
Now anyone is free to waltz right in
My temple's been invaded
And there's nobody guarding it
All over this lonely life
But what's so wrong with being all alone?
Alone's the only way I've ever known


If you're not ready, you're not ready
Please stop acting like you are


How could I know
That everything you say are lies
About devotion and desire?
And I know the spark
Inside your eyes was just the match
I used to set myself on fire


And I'm pleading
'Cause this kills and
It's still bleeding
My darling
I'm taking
My life back
To start healing


How could I know
That everything you say are lies
About devotion and desire?
And I know the spark
Inside your eyes was just the match

I'd like to take you out
We'd go to The Hail Mary
And afterwards make out
Instead, I'm typing you a message
That I know I'll never send
Rewriting old excuses
Delete the kisses at the end
When I see you, the whole world reduces
To just that room
And then I remember and I'm shy
That gossip's eye will look too soon
And then I'm trapped, overthinking
And yeah, probably self-doubt
You tell me to get over it
And to take you out
But I can't, I'm too scared
And here's the night bus, I have to go
And the doors are closing, and you were waving
And I like you, and I'll never let it show

That you ""rock my world""
But you do, you really do
You've turned me upside down
And that's okay, I'll let it happen
'Cause I like having you around
I'm electric, a romantic cliché
Yeah, they really are all true
When we catch eyes at that stupid party
I know exactly what to do
I'll take your hand, and we will leave

With your heroes on the wall
In the fading light
Through the window I see
All your poplar trees

The storm rising up
Our hair tangled up
My words are tangled up
The home we're thinking of
We'll fall soon enough
We'll fall through the ground

Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo-whoo-whoo

Sings a song

Whoo, baby, whoo

And the days go by
Like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own
I begin again
Said to my friend, baby (Everything stops)
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more
(He was no more)
Than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken hearted
Somethin' within him
But the moment
That I first laid
Eyes on him
All alone on the edge of seventeen

Well, I went today
Maybe I will go again
Tomorrow, yeah, yeah
Well, the music there
Well it was hauntingly familiar
When I see you doin'
What I try to do for me
With their words of a poet
And a voice from a choir
And a melody
Nothin' else mattered

The clouds never expect it
When it rains
But the sea changes colours
But the sea
Does not change
So with the slow graceful flow
Of age
I went forth with an age old
Desire to please
On the edge of seventeen

Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Said, whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo


Well then suddenly
There was no one left standing
In the hall, yeah, yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
When I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singin'
(Come away)
(Come away)
(Come away)


Just like the white winged dove

Well, I hear you (Well, I hear you)
In the morning (In the morning)
And I hear you (And I hear you)
At nightfall (At nightfall)
Sometimes to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you

Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

What creates my own madness
And I'm addicted to your punishment
And you're the master
And I am waiting for disaster

Getting away with murder
It isn't possible
To never tell the truth
But the reality is I'm getting away with murder

I think my thoughts when I don't even need to
I never look back because I don't even want to

I am the watch you always wear, but you forget to wind


Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes


I submit no excuse
If this is what I have to do
I owe you every day I wake
If I could I would shrink myself
And sink through your skin to your blood cells
And remove whatever makes you hurt but
I am too weak to be your cure





I'm not letting you check out
You will beat this, starting now
And you will always be around
I'm there to monitor your breathing
I will watch you while you're sleeping
I will keep you safe and sound

I want my money back

To spend it on a better heart
To wear upon my sleeve
And it might take a sec
My world's become a mess

So if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is

If you want trust
I'll need my conscience back

My broken back has carried all
The weight I thought I'd need
And it might take a sec

I'd miss are obsolete

Verse

First off Lord bless to king Emrose
Give that boy some tissue
So he can wipe his nose
Dat be that devil

Once me and Em got him
His subscribers were fried
Sicks and stones will break my bones
But you charging God's people
Now heaven's not your home

Now back to the boogie I'm a leave dat agent alone
I let Vince and Cortez hit dat boy with the chrome
But we all kings we don't have to lift a finger
Mane what was I saying?
He said that boys a stranger

Lord Bless to king Ellis, king David, king Sam
One time king Michael heating it up like hell
Malik keep it fleek with king AB
Oh yeah Duval I ain't forgot about ya'll
We gonna hit Child Support make they whole kingdom fall
I don't care if they were in the middle of putting on their draws
But if they were in God they would stumble and not fall
Credit score 300
Child Support claim it's a loan....
Let us gladiators invade Rome

I am who I am hit em with a Qui Tam
They not doing it for the gold
They doing it for they uncle Sam
Send me mail on the land I'm not raising my right hand
I give you no jurisdiction
Keep your corporate fiction
God has no respect of person
So my spirit ain't hurting

Reflects the complex hybrid dialect, now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super future-esque style

The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath from emotional stress
With special effects and a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

The mightiest of weapons swinging right from the chin
To elevate mental states long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends

It's goin' down, style assimilation, readily
Trekking through the weaponry of a pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be, we're advancing steadily

It's going down sub-terrestrial high
A rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

I was lying in my bed
I couldn't of been no more
Than one or two

Coming from the room next door
And my mother laughed
The way some ladies do

When it's late in the evening
And the music's seeping through


The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah

And down along the avenue
Some guys were shooting pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella groups, yeah

Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah


Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke
Myself a ""J""

And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began
To play

And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away


The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do

Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way that I loved you

And it was late in the evening
And all the music seeping through

From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you


Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me


From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill

Let the ashes fall, forget about me

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo


If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard


Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, lets go


Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go


We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door


Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go


Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go


C'mon, baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah

Let's go crazy


Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go
Go (Go crazy)


I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go)

A headache in the morning

Give me all your true hate

In that dress growing ever tighter
We were saddened the lengths she had gone to
To appear more attractive
In the process losing something
We never knew but still missed

You knew you were lost as soon as you saw her
You saw your life as a series of complicated dance steps
Impossible to learn, they had to come naturally
Together you squirmed and wriggled
And I could only jerk along behind

They're going to hurt you
They always will

She was now with me inside of you
And I could only stare wide-eyed
As everything closed in around the three of us
Things you never saw, talking of the power and rescue
The blood rushing through our bodies
And it was good

They're going to hurt you
They always will

She opened the door with face bruised and swollen
Before we knew, pushed, falling down curved stairs
Our message lost and our plans forgotten
Surrounded by men in suits and black shiny shoes
Moving in, kicking, stamping
Blank expressionless faces
A handful of marbles thrown at a dustbin
Then release, then release

They're going to hurt you
They always will

(In a Northern town there were amazing rows of standing stones arranged on the southern slope)
They got out in the last few seconds of consciousness
(Look for their inscriptions one day, the most distant ocean plains, those who make the desert island)
I saw you in a tin bath, red water
(Were the ones who went to Washington to do their laundry
They wanted to see the mysterious hurricane)
I never believed in you, or what you pretended to stand for

Good news already
The past is too heady
Go to mass or fast it’s all heading
In the same direction
Introspection
Love and peace
No need for protection
It's time to connect
And realize interconnection
‘Cause these words
They depend on your ears
And most propaganda
That depends on our fears
And I hear too much us and them
What if we could say
“Fuck what you stand for
But you're still our friend”?
What if we could bring all violence to an end?
Armed with the weapons of love and compassion
Empathy for demons who don't know their actions
Mindfulness
We can no longer turn a blind eye on this
And if I die
I'll focus my mind on bliss

You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up, you spread me all around
In the the dust of the deed of time

It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone

You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there

I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own, sitting way up high



Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods
I used her she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share

Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
And it was summertime
Mhm, sweet summer time, summer time



And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

From the ashes rose a demonic blade
Crafted by hatred and sent to enslave
Cast away in the deepest cell
Guarded by angels from demons of hell


Rise from the flames below
The blade provides supreme control with powers unknown
Hidden from evil to preserve its flame
Now is the time to carry out its fate


And on that fated day
The demons, they came
Slaying the angels and stealing the blade
Given to a king with a heart of black
He gathers his soldiers and prepares to attack


Rise from the flames below
The blade provides supreme control with powers unknown
Hidden from evil to preserve its flame
Now is the time to carry out its fate


As the fallen ones return to their master
They fester in evil and bellow with laughter
The angels knew hell shall befall
Inside this kingdom of rage
His mind becomes deranged
With plans of domination
To create a demonic nation


A land of redemption
A land to renew
A loss of all kinds
Both wicked and true
A storm of darkness fills the sky with destiny
The burning gates of the depths of hell will bring
A thousand demons rise as one
This war has begun, the charring of flesh, pure devastation
This ancient evil has pleasured my mind
Bestowing me power to control all of time
Lest I die, all existence is mine


Surrender forever
With my might, eternal night
Enslaved by rage
This sword beckons me




I foresee fallen kings
Release me from my sheath
Die by my hand
This ancient evil is at my command




This blade placed inside my hand
Fueling my hatred, this will be the end
No use, so give in
And now just bow your head to your king
The flames of this blade will kill everything",Calm

Biding your time
On the other ocean
Falling into line
In the cold and dim


Wherever you run
You see all you leave behind you
Lies inside anyone you open

On the other ocean

Was he not quite
As you had conceived him?
Did the color of the light
Hide the fight in the eyes?


Wherever you run
You see only eyes behind you
Lies inside anyone you open

On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean






So, do
You think the smoke it won't enfold you?
Or there'll be someone waiting for you
Off in the distance, then?

If only anything could change you
If only you knew what you claim to
If only every sign you cling to
If only they were so

Turn any eye into the ivy
And I won't bleed out if I know me

Oh I would lead it in the morning
Oh I won't even if I know it

Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I’ll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch


Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Down!


We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry and the cold
We are the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told
But we’ve been sweating
While you slept so calm in the safety of your home
We’ve been pulling out the nails
That hold up everything you’ve known


Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!


So open your eyes, child
Let’s be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way
Keep quiet no longer
We’ll sing through the day
Of the lives that we’ve lost
And the lives we’ve reclaimed
Go!


Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now

A comfy seat, pump this beat, Pressure will set the occasion
For your entertainment, I work hard on my flows
This scene is full of falling MCs, I wear hardhats to shows
And every Hip Hop head’s a critic, cause some hit the stage hard
But couldn’t get these arseholes open at a gay bar
It’s a comedy festival; they’re so unintelligible
Can’t work out if they got peas for brains, or they’re just vegetables
It’s sounds pathetic as me being anorexic
I do damage like a paralytic paramedic with no anaesthetic
Girls shake my hand, guys want to hug me, it’s a worry
If I forgot your name I’m sorry, you’re probably pretty ugly
I’m scared of getting old, so when it comes D-Day
I’ma thank you all for dissing me, then say something clichéd
And when I’m dead and buried I want youse in Life. Be in it. shirts

But then it happened (What happened?), what I thought could
I screwed all these MCs (Yeah?), then it got awkward
""It got weird didn’t it? It got weird...""
You don’t wanna see me anymore

Break it down like a molecule, we burning like fossil fuel

We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades


Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came (Came)
And times continued to change (Change)
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades!


We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk


From a different solar system
Many, many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission, to help the others listen
And groove from land to land, singin' electronic chants like
Zulu Nation


Revelations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations


Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me

We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble, the horns, and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat, we get fresh



Come on

Was something called ""The Bay Street"" beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade in those days
To take a man to the dance floor

And in the night, it was a drunken stutter
Started as a next to nothing conversation
And then he's tearing me out
Taking me apart at my friend's house
I was uncomfortable, I was hurt
Still with blue innocence in his eyes
I felt my reasoning was harsh


With every stab wound and exhale, I promised myself
That I would never lose my useful fears of grown up men
I'm scarred with cruel intentions
I thought of another the whole time
Who would have never stared me like that
See, he saw me as a human
This one thinks I'm a slaughterhouse


He pretends that he's understanding
And you know in the grand scheme of everything
He's probably called a nice man
Or an ordinary kind of man
Or a stereotype with strong hands, I'm so sad
At how little joy I realized within my time with my ex guy
Before these statues arrived


Romance is dead and done
And it hits between the eyes on this side
The grass is dead and barren
And it hurts between my thighs on this side


I could begin to open up and risk desire
For I move slower and quieter than most
I grew up too quick and I still forgive too slow
Oh, I wish there was another way

And it hits between the eyes on this side

Go my own way and meet you in the end

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
I have to go, I have to go
Your hair was long when we first met


Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of Wonder bread, and went right back to bed
And history books forgot about us and the Bible didn't mention us
And the Bible didn't mention us, not even once


You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the stars came falling on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light
Your hair was long when we first met


Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
Told me I was beautiful, and came into my bed
Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me 'til the morning light, the morning light
And he kissed me 'til the morning light


Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of Wonder bread, and went right back to bed

It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten


There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear


So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know


That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!


And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days
That deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand
Now do you understand?


So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know


That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you

But so much left that I don't know

It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

Back and forth through my mind

Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do


And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""

Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord

And I will sing no more

Tell me ""Go back home""

Calusa to your Juan Ponce De Léon
Make sure it's peppercorn sauce on my filet mignon, my nigga


One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone
Who thought we'd be fighting all alone?
Who don't know the rights from the wrong?
Truth comes to the light behind it all


My first reaction, raise my hands up along with my antenna
Sinner 'cause we born sinners, killers 'cause we want dinner
Try to warn niggas, better keep on growin'
Try to stay away from foreign, nigga
Better recognize when the Devil show his horns
He enjoying his whores like Donald Goines
There's a difference 'tween yours and Tomeka and Lauren
Young Warren Buffet in his prime, you ain't even know it
How she supposed to get thick? You just be feedin' her corn
With your corny ass get robbed while she fuckin' on your horny ass
Go to jail, tell it all before you ask for your attorney ass
Nigga, look, you could never be me
Knew who I was 'fore I got out the trap to sell a CD
I been shoulder-shoulder with gangstas facin' LAPD
Felony after felony, still they be yelling me free
Now my philosophy is, ""No possession, no apostrophe""
'Cause ain't no use in being in prison, you ain't gotta be
Ironically, we dodging crazy crackers with hammers
Just how they used to dodge nigga with braids and bandanas
Man, it been more mass killin' than it's days in the year
Wonder if fighting for it worth as much as leaving it here
I'm sayin'


One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul

Pour a little salt, we were never here

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall

Right in this moment, this order's tall


And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines


Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My my my, my my my, my my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split


And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced

And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

She'll make a fool of you all

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over


But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know


But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ahhh)
And I don't even need your love (Oooh)
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ahhh)

That God himself did make us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death
When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

How does she know who I am?

We held a funeral and a wake at the Diamondback Saloon
With every old-time cowboy agathered in one room
Swappin' tales and tellin' lies from days when they were young
Fearless buckaroos who always let the ponies run

I still see us behind the chutes, standin' in the sun
Light reflecting off the shiny buckles that we'd won
Farmin' boys from everywhere, just a ropin' in our dreams
Buckin' down the highway in old trucks and faded jeans

Cheyenne days to Fort Worth nights, we drove every inch of road
We often spoke our dreams out loud, sharing rooms and dirty clothes
The bandaged up, the broken ones, too tough to ever cry
The one we won the big go around, the drinks were ours to buy

Days were filled with mundane chores that kept us lean and mean
But our nights were spent out dancin' with the fairest girls we'd seen
Regaling them with wild ass tales, that weren't that far from true
There wasn't a single favor asked that your old pal wouldn't do

And every year the finals drew us back to OKC
Shoulders, Mahan, Steiner, Vol, T-bone and old Duffy
And when the dust had settled and the last go-round was run
We stayed up all night singing songs 'til every song was sung

The broken bones and broken hearts that led to broken homes
And the trails we rode together, now we travel on alone
And the friends we saw each summer, now we hardly saw at all
A little something's broken off each time a cowboy falls

Well adios amigos, see you down the line
I sure enjoyed the bullshit, cause it brought back some good times
And if you see those pals we knew from days when we were young
Tell them I stil saddle up just to feel the ponies run",Sad

Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
And you never had a chance
Love it or leave it, you can't understand a pretty face
But you do, so carry on, and on, and on


I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
I'm just the way that the doctor made me
On, and on, and on, and on
Love is the red, the rose on your coffin door
What's life like bleeding on the floor, the floor, the floor?


You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe


So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will


Preach all you want, but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me
Hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of a serpent son
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one, and one, and one, and one


You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe


So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will




You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
You wanna follow something, give me a better cause to lead
Just give me what I need, give me a reason to believe


So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill

Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, hadn't much to say

How you was, where you could be found

Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow, and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favourite song
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes

The night is young at the Dazzler
I spiked my own drink, took myself to bed
Alone I pondered the cheap frills of hotels
The miniatures, the endless throwaway towels
One for my hair, one for my foot
Another for my other foot
My face, my neck, my spilled beverages


Drunk in my hotel room, I look perfect
I look like I'm 24 before I caught your coldness
God, I'm gorgeous
I keep begging for late checkouts
Let me stay here, let me live here
In room 232 till I expire, I can shower for hours
Leave the lights on, I'm not paying those bills


The neighbours are quiet, no one is back yet
I think about the falsity of hotel sex
Expensive bedsheets and the orange glowing filaments
The way you used to say you loved me
In the heat of it, holiday feeling
When it wasn't over too quick
Yeah, I'll throw the TV out the window
And I'll paint the whole room gold
I'll make potions with the minibar
Yeah, I feel unbalanced, put my feet on the walls
Try and reach you all night, I'm not paying for calls


Oh, this is heaven
Alone
Yeah, this is living

We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun, and it was 1981


We named him 'Baby', he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long, because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it


Now we're a family, and we're alright now
We got money, and a little place to fight now
We don't know you, and we don't owe you
But if you see us around, I got something else to show you




Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy? Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm, but there's just something wrong with you
Just feel that you're the hardest little button to button

I had a brain that felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard with nothing in it
Except a stick, a dog, and a box with something in it

And the inhabitants thereof were drowned
Sparks frightening and there were exceedingly sharp lightnings

An invisible alien hawk stalks the lost jungles of Asia
Killing soldiers, thrilling heat holders
The eldest dragon, you be held assassins
Whether cellar mast, been backwards clever never

The Tasmanian devil was called the devil by early European settlers
Who were terrified by its demonic cries lost

Words chosen, stolen, so misbehaved by a thug
MC so badly crushed
That he was loosing a cup of blood with every heartbeat
I stalk obsolete
At night, I walk and talk on the street, the midnight rambler
I've been waiting for four long years, buried in the sand
Under the shade of a tree, and it's just a matter of time
Until a large man will use the tree as a sun shade
And that's when I launch my attack, nigga I can rap
The assassin bug lives in Latin American, the best
Does your home have an uninvited guest?
The body will shut down after losing on floor
Four Pints of vital thresh
When the sun goes down in America
Just South of nowheres, sos don't go there
A murder in Silent Hill, for real, I'm the violent tyrant still
A deadly spider crawling in your toys
Boys in New York there are nine rats to every person
This one, my noise, red heavy curtains
When the moon goes down in America, an executioner goes to work
Gloriously destructive, the eldest dragon
I'm sinister as a ghost that lurks. A murder on Shadow Mountain
Police blood hounds used to track down the killer
The stealth hazard, you draw it in
And store held captive by armed men

Find the last hazard county, Alaskan light madmen standing

Chinese wine, I'm hollow, I swallow my pocket change to a dime
No discreet street patriotic language. I am Procrustes
A villain of Greek mythology who made his strange victim's anguish
Inlaid, work made from small pieces

We can debate life
We can debate life about a piece of unrecorded tape
That is used for threading the tape onto a tape drive
Lose when you snooze and ooze women who gather supports
Reports or comments on the news. Enemies bleed
Famous for some bad quality or deed
Like a hired killer. A campfire thriller
London England produced the first police force the niggas lost
Medieval during the village at night hyenas hurt fifty people
And black mamba has been known to kill seven people in, in fact
One attack. The scorpion kills one thousand people every year
Snakes are only carnivores themed, a fucking box jellyfish sting
In 1897 Bram Stoker wrote Dracula. Off a place staked
The werewolf coyote he escaped
Ignore it, signs of the vampire's legend began in Eastern Europe
Where blood sucking creatures were once thought to be
The souls of the dead that rose from the bed and grave quiet
And wandered about the night, to drink the blood from living
But hombre I'm eyeful with a rifle
Like Clint Eastward in Unforgiven
I'm above it to no purpose, thinking nothing of it
My Chronos is like playing catch or skipping rope with a ghost
The holocaust, I leave you lost like, in hope
A large Bermuda triangle boat, Holmes. I'm loud
So bloods on the wing. Alcatraz is too proud

Wooden floors, walls and window sills

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees


By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me

To my UFO friend
Goodbye, goodbye
Like a seed in the wind
She's taking up root in the sky
See her flickering
Her system won't even try
To defend and ripen
In the radio action


She'll never return again
Polarize, polarize
The seasons will bend
There will soon be proof
That there is no alien
Just a system of truth and lies
The reason, the language
And the law of attraction


Just like a bad dream
You'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here
To deepen our love
It isn't even a fraction


Switch to another lens
The last sunlight
I don't need any other friends
The best kiss I ever had is the flickering
Of the water so clear and bright
To leap in, my skin
And I could feel the reaction


Just like a bad dream
You'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here
To deepen our love
It isn't even a fraction

Carves craters from my eyes
They said ""Breathe deeply, son

Beneath the falling night
And heaven's shutting gate
""Pray keep your tongue held tight
Or suffer the same fate""


""The blood on our black gloves
It is none of your concern
If you want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn

""Don't flinch when innocents
Are dancing with the flame
If they wanted to live
They'd learn to play the game
You can still walk away
If you just hold your tongue
If you'd just walk away
You'd live to see the sun""


But, under this killing moon
Under this burning sky
The fire's shining groom
I hold my breath and close my eyes

Vacancy in a burned out frat
You're an empty stare from a vagrant cat
You're a vagabond
Bag is packed and you move along


Mona came from the sea
Caught land gracefully
Night is cold but you know it felt so free


Camped up in a graveyard
Took a job to clean some tombstones
Like lovers in a shadow of a crooked dream


It's a long, hard day at a work
They called you mad for singing
Oh, do you remember when you blew away?
The wind rolls through the trees
It's neither faith nor warm
The sun has set when you come to find me there


Frozen in a ditch
Cold, deep stare like a cat
And we'll move along


Sean Pierre came from the roads
His artwork remains unsold
He holds such a heavy load
You know it's so far gone
He tells me he can hack it
In his old black leather jacket
Keep a hold on to your strangest
We're rollin' home


When you meet him at the train station
He was dressed to the nines
Things are changing now, we move along

Oh
What we’re living in
Let me tell ya

It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell
What magic spells
We’ll be doing for us
And I’m giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can’t see
I can’t breathe
No more will we be

And nothing’s going to change the way we live
’Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Whoa
It’s a crazy world we’re living in
And I just can’t see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these

Futures
Made of
Virtual insanity, now always
Seem to
Be governed by this love we have for, useless
Twisting
Of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
For we all live underground

And I’m thinking what a mess we’re in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip
The sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother
Can choose the colour
Of her child
That’s not nature’s way

Well that’s what they said yesterday
There’s nothing left to do but pray
I think it’s time to find a new religion
Whoa, it’s so insane
To synthesize another strain
There’s something in these futures that we have to be told

Futures
Made of
Virtual insanity, now always
Seem to
Be governed by this love we have for useless
Twisting
Of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
For we all live underground, whoa

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh
There's nothing so bad
As a man-made man
Oh, yeah
I know yeah

I know I can't go on

Ooh
Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change
Yeah
Things
Will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in

Oh, virtual insanity

Oh, this world
Has got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual

That we're living in
Where we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what it is

Be governed by this love we have for useless

Now we all, we seem to be governed
By a love for this useless twisting
Of our new technology
And now there is no sound
For we all live underground

Now this life that we live in
It's all going wrong
Out of the window

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand


I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?


I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it


So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change


Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want


That's why we're waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change




And we're still waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

I feel like there's a wind that could catch all my fingers, fly away
Past towers of iron and cement touching sky over rivers continents wide
Onto rolling walls with billions inside, augment my view of life, white cliffs isle's east side
Blue fields of five waving patiently while I slide into new scapes of change

Because tomorrow I'll be gone
And all that now surrounds me will keep moving on
When I look back what will I see
Will I have learned a lesson, something I believe

Give me a journey
Show me all the colors of life
Give me the distance
Show me a way to navigate this world
Give me a journey
Show me the road that I should take
There is no reason
To be stuck in just one place

Give me the journey
Paint with the watercolors of life
Give me the distance
To walk the image I create
Give me the journey
Show me the road that I should take
There is no reason
To be stuck in just one place

Keys unlock the plain to golden gates that lock again a violent bay
Where will I land and what will fill my eyes - who will I be each time that I arrive
Blades of grass cutting lines in the dirt and burnt goodbyes I've seen that star it guides my night
By sea or land, shifting air, how I move I don't care
Kiss me soft let me go, breathe in me the place you know - I want to know it too (spoken)

Out of the window there's a scene I seem to have seen each morning
White circles, red squares, I bet you don't see this everywhere
Sure I learn and like and am the things that fill this street
But could you be content knowing each day these moments just repeat
So a thought, a pass, a plane, a ticket marked with ink by name
A taxi pull, a plastic tray folded upright till we leave the runway

Way above the clouds
Freedom's pure when you don't hold out
Watch the weight of all you've known
Pass right under where you've flown
And all the things that seemed to matter
Grow much smaller worn and weathered
Final approach, we're going down
Prepare to land on foreign ground
Way above the clouds
Freedom's pure when you don't hold out
Watch the weight of all you've known
Crash and burn somewhere below
Crash and burn without a sound

Off the wing it looks the same till clouds give way
A new domain beckons me to play
A new song, new life, new ways to fly
Grab on, hold tight, It's gonna be a wild ride

I wanna fly far away
Wanna see a different place
Where to go, I don't know
There is so much left to see - so

I don't know where to go from here
I don't know where to roam
What will I see tomorrow
Where will I sleep tonight
Who will I meet tomorrow
And who will I kiss goodbye

I don't know where to go from here
Still don't know who I am
In spite of all my travels
In spite of all I've seen
My mind replays the memories
And you can't take that from me

But who knows where to go from here
And who cares where I go, do I have to know
Where this road's leading, no place to sleep tonight
The sun just keeps repeating its pattern in the sky

Give me the journey
Paint with all the colors of life
I'll walk the distance
To live on the canvas that I stain
With every memory
Coursing through my veins
There's just a brush
And I am the world it paints

Tell me where to go from here
Tell me I can stay so I see you tomorrow
I'll sleep with you tonight
If I have to go tomorrow
Then I kiss your lips goodbye

I don't want to go from here
And will you understand when you wake up
And I'm not there in the middle of the night
These eyes have yet to see what's under all these skies

Give me the journey
Pour out the colors of my life
I see the distance
In the mirror passing by
Give me my journey
In every shade and stride
There is no reason
Why our worlds should collide

All I've seen and all I've come to know has carved me
With patterns you can trace to realize our differences
Are not for the better or the worse they simply just are
Taught in miles, learned by path, leave it on my epitaph
Embrace each uncomfortable moment then relax
The news alive and educates he who doesn't wait
But packs willing to return to the same space

For the first time
I am living
In colors I'm picking
But you keep on stalling
What cha gonna be if your never see

For the first time
You're given
A fresh pallet
You're mixing
But you can't keep on slipping
Back into the place that cha can't leave

I wanna stay in a place
And I must appreciate
Where I've been, what I've seen
Even though they're different things - and

Now that we've found common ground
I have a way to understand
What you are, how you work
What defines a peoples worth - now

I close my eyes, fall asleep
Knowing I fulfilled my dream
Now it's your time to fly
See the world with open eyes",Calm

was water

Fish
fowl
flood
Water lily mud
My life

in the leaves and on water
My mother and I
born
in swale and swamp and sworn
to water

My father
thru marsh fog
sculled down
from high ground
saw her face

at the organ
bore the weight of lake water
and the cold—
he seined for carp to be sold
that their daughter

might go high
on land
to learn
Saw his wife turn
deaf

and away
She
who knew boats
and ropes
no longer played




She helped him string out nets
for tarring
And she could shoot
He was cool
to the man

who stole his minnows
by night and next day offered
to sell them back
He brought in a sack
of dandelion greens

if no flood
No oranges—none at hand
No marsh marigold
where the water rose
He kept us afloat




I mourn her not hearing canvasbacks
their blast-off rise
from the water
Not hearing sora
rails’s sweet

spoon-tapped waterglass-
descending scale-
tear-drop-tittle
Did she giggle
as a girl?




His skiff skimmed
the coiled celery now gone
from these streams
due to carp
He knew duckweed

fall-migrates
toward Mud Lake bottom
Knew what lay
under leaf decay
and on pickerel weeds

before summer hum
To be counted on:
new leaves
new dead
leaves




He could not
—like water bugs—
stride surface tension
He netted
loneliness

As to his bright new car
my mother—her house
next his—averred:
A hummingbird
can’t haul

Anchored here
in the rise and sink
of life—
middle years’ nights
he sat

beside his shoes
rocking his chair
Roped not “looped
in the loop
of her hair”




I grew in green
slide and slant
of shore and shade
Child-time—wade
thru weeds

Maples to swing from
Pewee-glissando
sublime
slime-
song

Grew riding the river
Books
at home-pier
Shelley could steer
as he read




I was the solitary plover
a pencil
for a wing-bone
From the secret notes
I must tilt

upon the pressure
execute and adjust
In us sea-air rhythm
“We live by the urgent wave
of the verse”




Seven year molt
for the solitary bird
and so young
Seven years the one
dress

for town once a week
One for home
faded blue-striped
as she piped
her cry




Dancing grounds
my people had none
woodcocks had—
backland-
air around

Solemnities
such as what flower
to take
to grandfather’s grave
unless

water lilies—
he who’d bowed his head
to grass as he mowed
Iris now grows
on fill

for the two
and for him
where they lie
How much less am I
in the dark than they?




Effort lay in us
before religions
at pond bottom
All things move toward
the light

except those
that freely work down
to oceans’ black depths
In us an impulse tests
the unknown




River rising—flood
Now melt and leave home
Return—broom wet
naturally wet
Under

soak-heavy rug
water bugs hatched—
no snake in the house
Where were they?—
she

who knew how to clean up
after floods
he who bailed boats, houses
Water endows us
with buckled floors

You with sea water running
in your veins sit down in water
Expect the long-stemmed blue
speedwell to renew
itself




O my floating life
Do not save love
for things
Throw things
to the flood

ruined
by the flood
Leave the new unbought—
all one in the end—
water

I possessed
the high word:
The boy my friend
played his violin
in the great hall




On this stream
my moonnight memory
washed of hardships
maneuvers barges
thru the mouth

of the river
They fished in beauty
It was not always so
In Fishes
red Mars

rising
rides the sloughs and sluices
of my mind
with the persons
on the edge",Calm

Verse 1

She like
She like I heard you got a deal
I learned you signed a deal
I heard they gave you a house a car and six mill
I hear you’re like wow what the people appeal
I’m like chill baby we should talk about the way we feel; about love about trust
Me, you, us
What we have between us is it love is it lust?
But as I dey talk were her eye dey go na my purse all my yarns follow dust for these words I am lost
Can’t even say if you are my girl or my cashier
All I fear is losing you to this insanity how can I be?
That all of a sudden you see me as a budget
Won’t think about me instead you think about my wallet
And look me in the eye and tell me sey that’s the concept
I fell into your soul but you fell inside my pocket
Too deep I can’t pull you out, it feels strange shawty I don’t even know who you are anymore

CHORUS
If sey you can look through my heart so you see for yourself as I dey see you right now? Right now
You’re everything I want right now, why now?
Why you all about the money? (*2)


Verse 2 (Eclipse)

Dear lord
My name is Femi
Been tryna talk to you lately but prayer don dey fear me
See my ways no pure
Na him I dey think
I no fit right my wrongs when I no carry ink
My relationships? Have never been true
Cuz half the girls only want me for the money and jewels
I said baby I love you and I can’t falsify the truth
No be today wey this tree don dey bear in fruit
And old habits die hard no reference to Bruce Willis
Ready to die for you I’ll do it if you with it
I love you with no limits
And shawty I do mean it
Tell me what you want I’ll get it in two minutes
Though my ego is twice the size of my head
I break it down for you
Let me make you queen of my bed
I get a crown for you
Let go of the cash I promise to be around for you
Just love me for me my wallet no go frown for you

Right now I can’t even tell the difference

She want the bar she want the paper
She no want a piece of land sey she want the acre
She no want the bread she want the baker
She got high standards but she not Jamaican

It's time to cut the ties
I need you out my life, out my life
I've wasted all my tears, now it's your turn to cry


Oh, 'cause I tried letting you in but you shut me out
I tried holding you up, you just let us both down
Tried to silence my pain when I wanted to shout
Now you're asking for love 'cause you've run out but
Just because you want it, doesn't mean you need it
You could say you're sorry, but you'll never mean it
I tried letting you in but you shut me out
You told me everyone hurts, well, it's your turn now",Sad

Shadows settle on the place that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time
From the perfect start to the finish line


And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong


We are the reckless, we are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day, we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there


And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone
We're setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from a flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked this home


And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it


Well, I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette
I'm a lifeless face that you'll soon forget
And my eyes are damp from the words you left
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest


And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone
Setting fire to our insides for fun
To distract our hearts from ever missing them
But I'm forever missing him


And you caused it
And you caused it

If this is our last goodbye until we're gone
Who cares about the wrongs we caused ourselves
'Cause I don't want to watch the world end with someone else


Fallin' deeper, deeper into hopeless thinkin'
Remember when you pulled me out
Wishin' you would come around again
When the room goes quiet
I'm hit with my regret like a riot
Reminds me what I really want
But have I waited for too long?

When I'm in motion it's just like the flow of the ocean
The weight of the words swerve and curve
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas
Quick as a Lamborghini, smooth as a Lexus
I guess that makes me the top of the line
Oh yes I'm the most prime of all time
Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin and the lyrics just start
To flowing, ahem ahem, coughing couldn't stop me from going
On with the rapture, so that I capture
Your mind with state of the art music made to adapt to
To knowledge the God on the groove
Because when my tongue moves I just love that I'm smooth
Do it with these and in times I leave reas (reason)
To give em a little of the flavor that please
As I, school in the who in pursuin and doin and reignin again and the
Gutter and stutter and killin and chillin collectin the rent and
Jammin and slammin and damn it's
Too much for one mind to comprehend
A pure blend, the way that I make words mend
And, the way that I be doin rappers in
Michael Bivins couldn't make these Boyz II Men
I display, somethin verbally, capable to murder the
Average MC, the tough ones I'll burn third degree
And if you're thinkin that I'm takin a beatin
You're sure to see the Pink Panther speakin


I'm a native New Yorker, I pitch a lot of porker

So get off the dillz and step back you little hawker
Better yet you hooker, you wanna show I book ya
The highest way I took ya, is youse a good looker
Queens is residential, I make the presidentials
Over instrumentals, I utilize the mentals
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square
If you went in by yourself it was a terror
See, I could do that cause my crew is kinda phat
Outside we had the toolies, out West you call em gats
It's that, oh thanks chat, well let me drop some more shit
Bring your bats and balls and please don't forfeit
Cause you won't get away, your status will be stank
You can ride with me G I'm goin to the bank
To meet up with Kane, up on Dollar Lane
You get the idea, cause page times is near
So rappers see they bug cause they really can't handle
Position from the rappin, cause some of them be slackin
Not in this sport of thought we block out the devil
The three different flavors, you know we on the level


Check it out, uhh! As I come down and get dumb
Yes roughneck, swingin along with the drum
Swimmin in the, track, retaliatin thorough is how
I react, Busta Rhymes will attack
As you feel the pain, bass kick impacts to the brain
Gotta make a mega migraine
Whattup? To the Big Daddy and Tip
My trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip
Hey, hip-hop, cool, bust the interlude
Wack do ya on the stage gettin booed
This structure it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors
On a young raider choc well that's my vocal fader
Keep my volume on extra boom!
All the vains in my neck symbolizes that I want room
Word up, huh! Here I am, damn
Dragon slayer stackin layer after layer
This jam will be ran while the record flim flam
Wiggle your front pram, to the runnin man

Flavor one, taste the unborn baby
Flip before you move or catch a bad one baby

You broke me first (You broke me first)
You broke me first, ooh oh",Sad
you were good to me,brent,Jeremy Zucker,4CxFN5zON70B3VOPBYbd6P,2019-05-03,76,219146,0.561,0.913,0.0848,2.62e-05,0.112,0.206,-15.099,0.0404,102.128,2,4,"
Lyin' isn't better than silence
Floatin', but I feel like I'm dyin'


Still, no matter where I go
At the end of every road
You were good to me
You were good to me, yeah
I know it's easier to run
After everything I've done
You were good to me
You were good to me


(Let's get this bread, son)
You were good to me
(Whatever you want)
(Hit me with that again)
You were good to me


Leavin' isn't better than tryin'
Growin', but I'm just growin' tired


Now I'm worried for my soul
And I'm still scared of growin' old
You were good to me
You were good to me, yeah
And I'm so used to lettin' go
But I don't wanna be alone
You were good to me
You were good to me, yeah, oh


God only knows where our fears go
Hearts I've broke, now my tears flow
You'll see that I'm sorry
'Cause you were good to me
You were good to me


And now I'm closin' every door
'Cause I'm sick of wantin' more
You were good to me
You were good to me, yeah
Swear I'm different than before
I won't hurt you anymore
'Cause you were good to me",Sad
